# Able Resource Hub (Replit Deployment)

This repository contains a lightweight resource page designed for deployment on platforms such as Replit, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and other open hosting environments. The goal is to provide easy access to helpful tools, guides, and compliance resources for care homes while supporting the broader Able ecosystem.
